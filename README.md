# BeatBridge server

This is a mocked backend for the BeatBridge mobile application - which uses the Bridgefy SDK to allow offline communication between mobile devices.

For ease of use, there is no databse, only the app.js. This is not meant to be a complete backend, only a way to mock requests from the BeatBridge mobile app.

## Instructions

npm install
node app.js
